 HTTP1.1

 HTTP/1.1 was its 1st standardized version that was available for use in the year 1997 for the end-users.
 This version presented considerable performance optimization over its precursors and changed how communication was
 handled between clients and servers.
 However, its key qualities opened the doors to many performance and API security loopholes.
 This approach surely ensures good performance, but it also is problematic.
 It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
 HTTP 1.1 introduced more detailed error codes and improved error handling, which can help developers troubleshoot and
 resolve issues more quickly.



 HTTP2

 HTTP2 Released in February 2015 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) focussed on improving HTTP performance.
 It is merely an extension, with all the core concepts such as HTTP methods, Status Codes, URL and Header Fields remaining
 the same.
 It allows Server Pushing to add responses proactively into the Browser cache.
 As a result, web pages containing several elements are delivered over one TCP connection.
 This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.
 Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.




 Objects and its internal representation in Javascript

 JavaScript is an open-source programming language. It is designed for creating web-centric applications.
 It is lightweight and interpreted which makes it much faster than other languages.
 JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.
 JavaScript does not use classes and class inheritance. Instead an object in JavaScript has an internal property called 
 its prototype that points to a second object from which the first object inherits properties.
 Unlike other data types, objects are capable of storing complex values.
