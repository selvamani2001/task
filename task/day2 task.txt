Document Object:

 The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser.
 Every web page resides inside a browser window which can be considered as an object.
 Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of 
 the page.
 Until the research for this article this was completely unknown to me, but actually this feature can be very practical.
 The Document Object provides different collection elements, such as anchor and Links which helps you to count the 
 number of specific elements on a form.
 Document is an object inside the window object and we use a document object for manipulation inside the document.





 Window Object:

 The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy.
 It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. 
 It returns a reference to the console object which provides access to the browserâ€™s debugging console.
 The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 
 All global JavaScript objects , functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
